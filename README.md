CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

**Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**

The types of frontend development in this project include Express HTML, which is a NodeJS framkwork that lets developers run their website on a custom web server, JavaScript, a form of Java that allows for interactive websites using CSS, and single-page application, a method where a website's data loads on a single page that loads more data as the user scrolls. The backend used NoSQL because data is stored in a format easier for websites to read while also allowing developers change the structure of data easier than other methods.

**Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**

JSON is a text-based way of formatting data by breaking up the variables, including nested variables of an object in a readable format. It ties together to frontend and backend developemnt because a JSON format allows for data to be sent or retrived from the application quickly since variables are easier to call to access. Code was refactored several times to improve functionality and efficiency. Not only was JSON used for items within the web page, but handlebar files were created for parts of the website that were consistent on every page, such as the header and footer of the page.

**Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**

Methods are used in general to call functions and have the program act based on what the user is trying to do. Endpoints are the end of a communication channel, which in an API context, can include functions like GET and PUT which access different components of a website. Security in a full stack application can mean a few things, such as a log in for a user to have an account, encrypting data users put in, and having a layer of secuity on the site itself to keep out hackers or attacks.

**Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**

When I was starting this course, I was in the process of interviewing for a job in the Computer Science field. I actually got a job during the time in this course where I will be using full stack applications, so having this course preparted me for my role.
